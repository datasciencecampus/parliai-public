# Repository name

# Introduction
## About
This is the open-source code repository for the internal ParliAI project, allowing other developers to replicate non-sensitive features of the project and to encourage future collaboration and development in this space. Please do contact us at [datasciencecampus@ons.gov.uk](datasciencecampus@ons.gov.uk) to discuss this or any of our other projects.

## Installation
Details to follow...

### Pre-commit actions
This repository contains a configuration of pre-commit hooks. These are language agnostic and focussed on repository security (such as detection of passwords and API keys). If approaching this project as a developer, you are encouraged to install and enable `pre-commits` by running the following in your shell:
   1. Install `pre-commit`:

      ```
      pip install pre-commit
      ```
   2. Enable `pre-commit`:

      ```
      pre-commit install
      ```
Once pre-commits are activated, whenever you commit to this repository a series of checks will be executed. The pre-commits include checking for security keys, large files and unresolved merge conflict headers. The use of active pre-commits are highly encouraged and the given hooks can be expanded with Python or R specific hooks that can automate the code style and linting. We are using `ruff` to ensure consistent Python code formatting.

**NOTE:** Pre-commit hooks execute Python, so it expects a working Python build.
